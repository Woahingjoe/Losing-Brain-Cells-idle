# Losing-Brain-Cells-idle
Hello there! The name is Edwin, I primarly made this project to continue working on html and learn some javascript. I am not disappointed.


An idle game mostly about losing brain cells at an increasingly rapid rate.
Features how many brain cells were lost, ways to increase amount lost, and money.
This uses bootstrap 4.0 as of writing this.

Version 1.5:
- Saving finally implemented, but not yet working as intended

Issues not yet resolved:
- Bad/ not fleshed out progression,
- No end goal,
- No way to delete save yet,
- No confirmations when saving,
- No warning or confirmations when loading
