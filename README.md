# Losing-Brain-Cells-idle
Hello there! The name is Edwin, I primarly made this project to continue working on html and learn some javascript. I am not disappointed.

An idle game mostly about losing brain cells at an increasingly rapid rate.
Features how many brain cells were lost, ways to increase amount lost, and money.
This uses bootstrap 4.0 as of writing this.

Version 1.6:
- On top of warning screens, new alert box for when game has been saved, loaded, or deleted.
- Text aligned some buttons
- Auto save every 5 minutes (should be 5)

Issues not yet resolved:
- Cannot change auto save time or turn off
- No auto close (Annoying!)
- Bad/ not fleshed out progression,
- No end goal,
